This project centers on the development of a web-based solution designed to enhance and streamline the thesis submission and binding procedures at the VSU Library. The current process faces challenges such as an inefficient queueing system, manual entry of details, manual receipt creation, and the need for manual retrieval of softcopies. Through this initiative, the project seeks to tackle these issues, ultimately improving the overall efficiency of material submission and automating the receipt generation process.
